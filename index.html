                My name is Gugulethu Mbele and I am a 24 year old female who stays in Johannesburg. I am fairly new in the tech space, sidenote: I did IT in high school but we used Scratch and Delphi which we coud barely count as programming languages. Also my main reason of choosing IT as a subject was to learn how to hack, do you think I could still get into it?
            My biggest passion in life is anything and everything youth development. I also started a Non-Profit Organisation where it focuses on the youth. I aspire and plan to use tech skills to make a difference in this space as well.

                <h2> Educational Background </h2>
                <p>I recently completed my Bachelor of Arts in Criminology. I grew up obsessing over true crime documentaries which sparked an interest in how criminals think and their behaviural instincts.
                     I plan to continue studying till I obtain a PhD.  </p>
        <p> 
         I choose to do IT related courses on the side and keep upskilling while simultaneously furthering my studies.
        I have so far attended 2 bootcamps namely, CodeTribe and WeThinkCode which cemented the foundation in coding. 
    I am currently a Power Learn Project Africa student and it has now given me the confidence to trust myself in coding and pacing myself while at it.  </p>

                <h3> Programming languages</h3>
                <li> Python: Intermediate </li>
                <li>SQL: Beginner</li>
                    I would like to learn JavaS as soon as I master Python.
